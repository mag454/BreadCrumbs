# BreadCrumbs

Breadcrumbs is an app that three of my classmates and I created our senior year of highschool as a 
final project for a semester long iOS Programming course.  We also submitted this app to the 
congressional app challenge and were named Finalists.  

Also in this repository is a news article published by my school about our project.  
It includes a link to a youtube video that we submitted as our presentation for the app challenge.  

Some of the code can be found in this github repository (https://github.com/SJP-CSD/breadcrumbs).  However this is not the final project as switched to dropbox at some point because it made it easier for us to do work at home.  
All of the code is also still in Swift 2.
